Welcome to Team3 Project !!!
Common Rules
1. Work with your own module
2. If you have any suggestion feel free to talk to team mates and inform Team Lead without delay.
3. This is a team work and massive collaboration required. We are going to use git hub for version control.
which is very sensitive if we do not maintain with care.
4. You all will have your own Branch of the project. You shall work in your own branch and push to your branch.
5. After proper review we will merge file to master.
6. Do not do any modification in Generic Part, if you want to have some change in generic part inform Team Lead and
consult with team mates. Git hub causes issue when multiple user changes same file in some given time. In order to
avoid this issue we have to follow few rules.
7. From my end if I make any change in CommonApPI/Generic part I will duly inform you all by any means and I am
always available to talk to team mates and changes in the ComonAPI shall be informed by all parties without delay.
